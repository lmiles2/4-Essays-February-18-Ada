## 5. (ONLY FOR REAPPLICANTS) What has changed since your last application? Please share any relevant work, study, or personal experiences.
I continue to ask questions of those I work with and the guests who come to my Building at Microsoft to determine what areas of tech best meet my expertise and interests. I’ve spoken with employees from Akamai to talk about CDN and the Cloud.  I’ve talked to vendors from PWC and the Airforce who’ve shed light on cyber security roles in IT. Talking to interviewees about Data Centers and UX Researchers about User Interface help me to see what’s out there.  My most valued discussions are with the Software Engineers related to the Cloud and front end web design where I want to focus.  At the suggestion of my interviewer during the previous Coding Challenge, I have watched the JumpStart Live videos which are hugely helpful in illuminating aspects of programming in ruby where I now understand the concepts behind various commands and the correct syntax.  My quantitative  work with Khan Academy continues.  I also continue to work on exercises in Learn Ruby The Hard Way and take Free Courses in Code School when the free weekends come up.  I read often articles on Linked In, those in my telephone News Feed which include CNN, Wall Street Journal, WIRED, the Huffington Post – anything about technology and the trends.  I now share those articles I’m interested in on Linked In.  I've added to my Linked In network.  My Twitter feed ramped up and I'm working on strategies to increase my followers.
