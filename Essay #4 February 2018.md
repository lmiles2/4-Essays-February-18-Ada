## 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn? What would you do differently?

Undercommit. Over Deliver.  Overcommit â€“ you get fun, tons of it.   This is now my mantra. I prefer to commit to a few things and excel at them rather than taking on many things.  With this attitude, I am more selective, realistic and have a sixth sense on what I will be able to contribute to achieve.  At work, my manager raised my sales quota to $30,000 in one month.  I became #10 salesperson in the market with $48k of sales in one month, but at the time my revenue was only $20,000.  After my success in my business LMCreativeCommunications, I was approached to raise money by five (5) organizations. At the time, I was holding a position as chair, UFSC Scholarship Dinner and Awards Show. The situation required prioritization, organization and strategy.  I met with each group to determine whether their goals met mine.  I focused on my new quota in sales by increasing my calls to 80 cold calls a day scheduling 8 intense sales meetings per week.  In my community activities, I chose 2 organizations.  With superhuman efficiency, I balanced and engaged in all aspects needed for the various projects and organizations always keeping my own job as the focus.  Both organizations successfully produced their initiatives and my sales increased.  Careful juggling, willingness to commit, scheduling tools and a requirement to engage propelled me to success in the roles I chose to assume. Now I carefully prioritize.  I only take on what I can do.
