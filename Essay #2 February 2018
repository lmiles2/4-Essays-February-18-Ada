## 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? How do you see yourself impacting the technology field?
In five years, I will be a front end web developer engineering websites that service the Cloud.  With my background in Psychology, Graphic Design and initial, basic understanding of the web development languages HTML and CSS, I will make a big splash in front end web development. The Cloud is now the center of technology.  As a front-end web developer, I will create a gateway to the consumer who interacts with this pioneering technology and storage capability.   I am especially interested in the javascript programming classes at Ada.  I expect that will be my favorite of the stacks.  Javascript delivers a seamless yet elegant web experience.  It is the script behind making buttons grow and expand, play music and video along with the web experience, as well as create animated effects that deliver a captivating website experience for each user.  In 5 years, I plan to be at the Software Engineer II level at a large company like Microsoft.  I particularly like Microsoft because of it’s emphasis on giving.  Employees are encouraged with empathy, making products which make the world a better place. At Microsoft, I am surrounded by the most successful.  The mission says it all  
“[T]o empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.”
