## 3. Read Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement. How will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?
As a native Northwesterner who was born and raised in Seattle, I have a specific story to tell about when and why my parents migrated here.  Many people in Seattle and in Tech are transplants and it is somewhat rare to find native Northwesterners.  At Ada, I would be excited to share stories to highlight what it is like being a native Northwesterner in the African American population.  Through my collaboration and effort, Ada could sponsor hackathons to develop software solutions and innovations for work in nonprofit fields related to diversity and inclusion. Working with these featured nonprofits, innovative technology solutions will be developed facilitating the work that these nonprofits do that in turn could be incorporated as Capstone projects or internships with Ada.  For Ada, I would organize get togethers for the program around specific topics whether it is an outing to a movie like “Black Panther” which relates to both African Americans and Technology or a potluck celebrating different foods of the cultures who migrated here.   I have connections with a few of the nonprofits in the area related to women and underrepresented minorities in Tech.  My daughter’s father, Eric Osborne is the co-founder of HERE Seattle, a networking and mentorship group for women and underrepresented minorities who are in the Tech field.  Extending Ada’s reach through partnerships with other non-profits will strengthen Ada’s mission both internally and externally as we focus on living out the Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement in our daily lives.
