I want to join Ada Developers Academy to change my career and delve further into the tech community where I exist on the surface as a Receptionist at Microsoft.  I seek to gain the solid technical background to become an influencer in the field.  In Development for the Northwest African American Museum, I added a pledge reminder report to our donor database system which did not exist in the system, but instead was presented as a customized, specialty report created by in-house consultants.  My boss suggested I offer to sell my version of the pledge reminder report to eTapestry, but the company insisted they knew how to create it – there was just  
an added cost.  They responded by publishing a Read Me file online with all the advanced steps that created the  
report when in reality, it could exist as a simple function on the user interface. As a trainer on SAP with AIG SunAmerica,  
my background informed the report.  My entrée into programming occurred at Stanford – the bastion of Computer Science.  
I took Intro to Computer Science.  In this course, I wrote programs which rarely worked and it was difficult to find the reason why. I attempted to get extra help.  It was difficult to return a working finished product.  In 2014, I took a free course Aquent provided   
in HTML, CSS and javascript.  I understood what programming for web development was about.  I felt truly redeemed with programming that I now was able to muddle through successfully.
